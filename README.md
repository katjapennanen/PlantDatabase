# PlantDatabase
Small school project (server programming). SpringBoot+Maven+JPA+h2+Thymeleaf+Bootstrap. A database to store/add/edit info of my many plants.
This project is deployed <a href="https://houseplant-manager.herokuapp.com/login">here</a> on Heroku (give it a few moments to wake up). The login credentials are admin/admin and user/user.

There are two versions, this one using h2 in-memory database, and <a href="https://github.com/katjapennanen/PlantDatabaseMariaDB">this</a> version modified to work with local MariaDB database.
